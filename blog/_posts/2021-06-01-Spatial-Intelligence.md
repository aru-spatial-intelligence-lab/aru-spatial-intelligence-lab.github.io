# From SLAM to Spatial Intelligence

When one thinks of robotics & in particular robots in relation to thier interaction with space, Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) algorithms generally come to mind. SLAM techniques incrementally build up the shape and the structure of the space around a robot while also keeping track of its position. This shape & structure give an explicit  

Spatial Intelligence.

## Shape & Structure

## Topology

## Scene Graphs

## Network Represenatations

## Space in the Subsumption Architecture
